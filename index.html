    <hr />
    <p>Welcome! Unless you're one of my close friends or acquaintances, I'm not sure how you got here...
       Well, since you're here, let me tell you about my project!<p>
       
    <p>The Katilruk Project is an ambitious project of mine, which I have been intermittently working on since around 2017, slowly developing it from a child's   
       simple fantasy, to a highly-detailed world, with history spanning millennia, unique cultures, and even a unique species in place of humans!</p>
       
    <p>Unfortunately, I am not yet ready to reveal it to the world; it is like a son to me, and I only want to release it once I feel it is developed enough. I plan to slowly reveal the world through books, from short stories, to epic novels! I also intend to make digital copies completely free, as this project is purely one of passion. However, if certain demand is met, I will offer physical copies for purchase.</p>
    
    <p>But fret not! If you're interested in the project, feel free to bookmark this page and return periodically, or subscribe to one of the social media 
       accounts I have set up for the project... Which I may or may not use... I guess I'll have to now!</p>
